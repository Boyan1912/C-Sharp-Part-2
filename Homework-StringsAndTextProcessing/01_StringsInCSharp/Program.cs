            // Strings are used for keeping and manipulating text information. Strings are basicly collections of characters (char array).
            // However they have some unusual properties: strings are read-only, meaning that you cannot implicitly change any of the values
            // within the array, you would have to create a new string or replace the current string with new one (str = str.Modified). Also
            // in contrast with arrays strings are non-referent type of object, meaning that each time you manipulate strings new memory is 
            // being used. That's why concatenating strings is a slow and inefficient process, you should use the class Stringbuilder for that.
            // Some of the most important methods of strings are: IndexOf(), Format(), Contains(), Join() and others, being used to retrive
            // and/or manipulate specific data within the string.
