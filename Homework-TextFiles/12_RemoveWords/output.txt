LIVERPOOL -- Daniel  has been cleared to play in Liverpool's Premier League clash with Manchester  on Sunday.

The striker was substituted as a precaution during Thursday's Europa League round of 32 second leg defeat at Besiktas and he is still regaining full match fitness, having returned in late January after five months out with thigh and calf problems.

Brendan Rodgers has admitted  he has to manage the 25-year-old  international's fitness to ensure he suffers no further problems.

The Liverpool manager said: "We just have to manage Daniel. He had given everything in the game. It's maybe easier to look at it from the outside and say he could have continued to play, but you've got to remember this is a player coming back from five months out injured.

"He's  who is gaining his fitness in the games, and we have to be really careful  he doesn't break.

"Daniel's history shows  he's got a past in terms of injuries, so we have to try to manage  in the very best way  we can. There's been very little training in between the games because the players have to play, recover and then play again.

"And he'd given everything. There was no more left in his legs. We just needed to take him off to prevent him getting an injury while he was very, very ."
