Sending a text is an approachable and casual way to start a conversation with your crush. Calling all of the time can make you look too eager, and following your crush everywhere can make you look like a stalker! Texting is low-key and a lot less nerve-wracking than face-to-face conversations or phone calls. So take a deep breath, summon your courage and start texting.

Send your first text. A simple "What are you doing?" or "What you up to?" is a good conversation starter.

    If your crush replies that he or she is watching television, listening to music or playing a game, reply by asking about what they're watching, listening to or playing. Whatever your crush says, you want to be ready with a follow-up question to keep the conversation flowing.
    Your crush may say something along the lines of, "I'm doing my homework." In reply, you can say something like "We got loads, didn't we? Mine took ages to finish!" Or if your crush doesn't go to your school you could say, "Oh poor you! Ha, did you get a lot?"
    Tell your crush what you're up to as well. When your crush texts you letting you know what he or she is doing, send a reply like, "That's cool. I'm just checking Facebook" or whatever else you're actually doing at the time.
